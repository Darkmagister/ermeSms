Installing
==========

This project is configured for waf; waf is shipped in the distributable
tarball but not in the repository.  If you need to get waf, run::

    wget -O waf http://waf.googlecode.com/files/waf-1.5.16
    chmod +x waf

Installation follows the steps::

    ./waf configure
    ./waf

then::

    ./waf install

or ::

    sudo ./waf install

You can use ``--prefix=$PREFIX`` when configuring to assign an
installation spot. By default, it is installed for all users.
Installing only for your user, the prefix ``~/.local`` is often used;
you just have to check that: ``~/.local/bin`` is in your ``$PATH``.
